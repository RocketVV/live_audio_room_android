# ZEGOCLOUD Live Audio Room

ZEGOCLOUD's Live Audio Room solution is a one-stop solution for building full-featured live audio rooms into your apps, including interactive live audio streaming, instant messaging, room management, and in-room controls.

In live audio rooms, users can host, listen in, and join live audio conversations. Users can also interact with each other via text chat, virtual gifting, "bullet screen" messages, and other features. In a single room, there can be up to 50 speakers at the same time and an unlimited number of listeners.

With ZEGOCLOUD's Live Audio Room, you can build different types of live audio apps, such as online werewolf (a voice-based social deduction game), online karaoke, and more.
